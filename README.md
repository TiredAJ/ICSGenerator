# ICSGenerator
Basically allows you to generate a very basic .ics file. Tested working on Windows PC & Android phone. I don't have anything Apple to test it with.

I know I've done MVVM wrong, this is my first project beyond tutorials working with Avalonia (coming from Winforms) and I'm still a bit puzzled tbh.
